# Dcano Portfolio

First of all, thanks for getting here!  üòç And now, let me tell you the story of my portfolio...

In the last months of 2023 I was sure that I wanted a **change on my career**, so that's why I started developing my actual portfolio. I developed it using **Next.js** and **Typescript** as base, **Sass** for the styling and **GSAP** and **Intersection Observer API** for handle some scrolling animations.  

For this project, I wanted to create a functional portfolio for sure, but I also wanted to learn/improve some of my skills so that 's why I used the latest version of Next.js, ```>13.5```, which allows you to use the new **App Router** and also thing like **Server Components**. Along with this I also took the **opportunity** to use Typescript, which was something I had wanted to do for a long time and hadn't had the chance to do.  
Regarding the portfolio **design**, I have tried to keep it simple, but with some curiosities like the random color that accompanies you throughout your visit and changes every time you visit it.  

Finally and despite being my professional portfolio, I did not want to lose the humor that I like to have, so there are certain texts in it that have a somewhat **humorous tone**, especially in the about me section.  

The portfolio is under deployment, so this would be the first version of it, some improvements will be coming üòÅ

### Get the project running

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
